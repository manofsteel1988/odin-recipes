    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto is one of the most popular pasta toppings in Italy. It originated in Liguria, specifically in Genoa. This flavorful sauce is made of basil, extra-virgin olive oil, parmesan cheese, pecorino cheese, pine nuts, garlic and salt, traditionally ground in a ceramic or marble mortar. It can be homemade or commercially prepared.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>3 cups (slightly packed, 65g) fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated (35g) parmesan</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (36g) pine nuts (toasted or raw)</li>
        <li>2 medium garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta water, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Cook spaghetti in salted water to al dente according to package directions. Before draining be sure to reserve the 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
